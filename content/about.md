Hi there, you've reached the website of Spell 3 Limited, which is a software engineering
consultancy owned by me - [Romanas Sonkinas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanas667).

Originally from Lithuania, I have spent most of my career in and around London, UK.

Generally speaking, I am a Software Engineer. More specifically, I've spent most of
my career in either the IoT or Cloud/SaaS world and know these things pretty well. I've also
dabbled somewhat into Machine Learning, but don't consider myself particularly technically 
competent in that field. 

Over the years, I've grown to a couple of CTO positions in startups, which made me understand
how to build products in a holistic way. I generally find common ground with both engineers
and management, and speak both of their languages. I like to remain hands-on, and am
not interested in purely managerial work. 

I am currently full-time employed as a CTO at [SenseAI Vision](https://senseai.vision), mucking about in the 
exciting field of electron microscopy.

On the side, I am involved in the world of early-stage startups, and work with a couple
of them on both product discovery and engineering challenges. 

## Things I think I'm good at

* Building systems religiously observing the KISS and YAGNI principles
* Building teams 
* Product-focused engineering
* DevOps and infrastructure topics
* Moving fast and breaking things
* ... and getting things done

## Things I don't think I'm good at

* Working with people who over-emphasise process and "correctness"
* Ossified organisations where it is impossible to get anything done

## Tech stuff

* Python
* Java
* C++
* C#/.NET
* Ruby (although I haven't touched this for a few years now)
* Kubernetes
* Linux/Unix stuff
* All sorts of Cloud/DevOps things (AWS, Azure, Terraform, Ansible, ...)
* Weird stuff like ZigBee and other things from the world of IoT
